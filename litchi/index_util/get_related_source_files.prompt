Here is the user's query:

```
{{ query }}
```

Here are the source code files and their names and purposes:

[
{% for item in source_file_indexes %}
  {
    "file": {{ item.file }},
    "name": {{ item.name }},
    "purpose": {{ item.purpose }}
  },
{% endfor %}
]

Return at most {{ max_file_count }} file names from the list that are most relevant to the user's query.

Make sure the JSON output is structured as follows:

```
{
  "files": [
    "string"
  ]
}
```
