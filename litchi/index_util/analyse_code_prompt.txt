I have the following Python code:

```
{{ code }}
```

Could you please explain what this code does, including the purpose of class and key part of the code?

Make sure the JSON output is structured as follows:

```
{
  "name": "string",
  "purpose": "string",
  "classes": [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "purpose": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```

This JSON output will help us understand the structure and functionality of the source code file in a clear and concise manner.
